# Google Form Auto-Filler

This script uses Puppeteer to automate filling out a Google Form with random data. It enters a random username, selects random multiple-choice options, and submits the form automatically.

## Installation
```sh
npm install puppeteer
```

## Usage
1. Replace `DEMO_FORM_ID` with your actual Google Form ID.
2. Update the input field names (`entry.123456789`) to match your form.
3. Run the script:
```sh
node formFiller.js
```

## Disclaimer
Use responsibly. Automating form submissions may violate Googleâ€™s terms of service.
